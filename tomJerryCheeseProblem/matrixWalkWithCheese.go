/*
There is a maze of size n*n. Tom is sitting at (0,0). Jerry is sitting in another cell (the position of Jerry is input).
Then there are k pieces of cheese placed in k different cells (k <= 10).
Some cells are blocked while some are not.
Tom can move to 4 cells at any point of time (left, right, up, down one position).
Tom has to collect all the pieces of cheese and then reach to Jerryâ€™s cell.
You need to print the minimum no. of steps required to do so.
*/

Step1 : First find all cheese location
Step2 : Find Minimum path  to reach one of above find location  from Tom origin and make it next origin position for next
recursive till you reach last find location
Step3 : find minimum path from last find location to Jerry position
